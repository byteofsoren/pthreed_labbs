# Purpose #
The Purpose for this labb is to calculate the determinant of a matrix.
But while I'm at it i can create "numpy"ish libary for c.
The main functions i want to create is
1. Create matrix with zeros.
2. Add number to array.
3. Show matrix.
4. Calculate the determinant single tredded
5. Calculate the determinant multi threaded.
